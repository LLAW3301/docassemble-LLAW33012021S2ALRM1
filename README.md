### Civil Internal Referral System<br>
---
<p>This application was created to consolidate the process of client referral<br>
into a a single, more efficient process. The application will ask the user for<br>
their clients' age, gender, region, general location and what areas they<br>
require support in. The application will then produce a list of applicable<br>
support services tailored to the clients needs. This list can be downloaded,<br>
printed and emailed as necessary to provide the greatest ease of use to the<br>
client.</p>

<p>The Civil Internal Referral System was created for, and in collaboration with,<br>
the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement. ALRM is a public not-for-profit<br>
organisation focused on protecting the interests and rights of Aboriginal and<br>
Torres Srait Islander (ATSI) people.</p>
